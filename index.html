									<h2 class="major">Our Story</h2>
									<p>LoadYourTruck was founded with a vision to modernize dispatching for today’s trucking professionals. What started as a small service helping local carriers quickly grew into a nationwide operation supporting multiple equipment types, lanes, and fleet sizes.

										Our experience in the logistics industry revealed what many carriers already knew:

										Dispatching can be overwhelming

										Many companies lack transparency

										Truckers often get undervalued in rate negotiations

										Paperwork and compliance slow down productivity

										We built LoadYourTruck to solve these challenges through professional service, technology, and a people-first approach.</p><section class="features">
